REST BUS SIMULATION - VECTOR CANOE

A complete Rest Bus Simulation project built using Vector CANoe, designed to emulate and analyze essential CAN Bus communications found in modern automotive systems. This simulation provides an isolated environment to test ECUs or understand vehicle communication protocols without access to a real vehicle.

Files

Restbussimulation.cfg: Vector CANoe configuration file
RBS_Dbc: CAN Database file
BCM.can: CAPL script for BCM
GWM.can: CAPL script for GWM
How to Use

Open Vector CANoe.

1. Load the project using Restbussimulation.cfg.

2. Make sure the Database.dbc file is correctly linked in the simulation setup.

3. Start the measurement.

4. The CAPL script (BCM.can & GWM.can) will begin transmitting and handling the CAN messages as per the simulation logic.

Project Highlights

üß© Implemented Rest Bus Simulation for critical automotive ECUs.

üì° Loaded and simulated CAN messages: ABS_Msg_Data_CAN, Ball_Game_Mode_CAN, BCM_Msg_1_CAN, Drive_Asst_Data_CAN, RDS_Coder_Data_CAN, and more.

üìö Created a complete custom CAN database (.dbc) for message and signal definitions.

‚öôÔ∏è Developed CAPL scripts to simulate message behavior, periodicity, and conditional logic.

üìä Enabled CAN traffic analysis using Vector CANoe's Trace and Graphics windows.

üí° Useful for testing ECUs in isolation, learning vehicle communication, or debugging diagnostic systems.
